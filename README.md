The application is created using React.js & included basic calculator features.

# Technical Details

The solution can be done with Redux as well, but as per time limits I have chosen React Stack to demonstrate the full fledged client side application. For CSS a lot can be done but right now its simple modular CSS.

## Tech Stack Used

- React JS as view layer
- Webpack as buid tool
- Webpack Dev Server for local development
- Yarn as npm package manager
- Bable as ES6 & JSX transpiler


More things I would like to add to this when we make it into later stages.
